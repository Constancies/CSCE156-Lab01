"""
A collection statistics-related functions that operate on
lists of numbers.

Note: we've named our functions minimum(), maximum(), and sumVals()
because python already has min(), max(), and sum() functions that
are built-in.  In general, those functions should be used instead of
these (we've only done this to demonstrate basic functionality and
unit testing).
